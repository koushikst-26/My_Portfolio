          Hospitals cannot really predict if a patient with diabetes will be readmitted based on their health condition. My predictive model of Readmission Rate of a diabetes patient gives them a probability of a patient being readmitted considering his or her medical history. This will help the hospital management to target particular patients and provide them with necessary insurance.

            <h4>Article Relection: Human Centered Artificial Intelligence and Workforce Displacement</h4>
            <p>
              Human Centered Artificial Intelligence and Workforce Displacement article by Stanford Business School focuses on human-centered AI and workforce displacement due to their significant impact in recent times and their role in revolutionizing various industries. According to a widely referenced 2018 study by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), AI is projected to generate $13 trillion in global economic value by 2030, with $9 trillion coming from automation alone (MGI, February 22, 2022a). This highlights the substantial influence automation will have on the future economy and the enormous potential of the automation industry. MGI also predicts that by 2030, the hourly demand for technological skills will increase by 55 percent, while the demand for social-emotional skills will grow by 24 percent (MGI, February 22, 2022b). This underscores the need for individuals to focus on both technical upskilling and the development of interpersonal skills. The anticipated increase in pay scales indicates that employers will expect high-quality skills from candidates. Given the rapid advancement of AI across all sectors, addressing these skill gaps is imperative. Yes, the word workforce displacement sounds a bit scary to be honest, given how there have been significant changes in work industry whenever there a new revolution in sector came up. Similarly AI is the next revolution. As how human always upskilled themselves better whenever required, we will do the same here by starting up AI professional chapter quite early. AI and automation can take over repetitive and mundane tasks, which can increase efficiency and reduce the need for human labor in those areas. This can be seen in industries like manufacturing, where robots perform assembly line tasks. AI is likely to transform jobs rather than completely eliminate them. For example, in healthcare, AI can assist doctors by analyzing medical images, allowing them to focus more on patient care. The demand for skills is changing. The impact of AI will vary across different sectors. Some industries may experience significant job displacement, while others may benefit from increased productivity and new job creation. There is an increasing need for workers with digital literacy, problem-solving abilities, and the capacity to work alongside AI technologies. Effective policies and education systems are crucial to help workers transition to new roles and acquire the skills needed in an AI-driven economy. While AI may replace certain types of jobs, it also has the potential to create new opportunities and transform existing roles. The net effect on employment will depend on various factors, including how society manages the transition and supports affected workers.
